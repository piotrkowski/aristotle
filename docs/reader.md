# The reader: rendering book pages

`crates/aristotle-render` is Aristotle's first e-book renderer. It uses the document engine of [Plato](https://github.com/baskerville/plato) (`plato-core`) and none of Plato's Kobo UI, and turns books into full-screen 8-bit pages for the PW4 panel. Its CLI, `aristotle-render`, renders pages to files on any host, shows them on the device with the page-turn strategy from [`native-vs-aristotle.md`](native-vs-aristotle.md), and measures CPU and panel time.

Status: renders EPUB, MOBI (DRM-free MOBI 7) and PDF on the host; the ARM build is waiting for its first run on the device. Numbers below are host numbers unless marked [dev].

## Architecture

```text
aristotle-render (CLI: info, render, show, bench, turn)
  └─ Book ─────────── plato-core
  │    EPUB, HTML ──── Plato's HTML engine (our font, Knuth–Plass, Liang hyphenation)
  │    MOBI ────────── mobi.rs → cached EPUB → Plato's HTML engine (MuPDF as fallback)
  │    PDF, CBZ, ... ─ MuPDF through Plato's PdfOpener, scaled to fit
  ├─ Page, Chrome ─── 1072 × 1448 buffer, stride 1088; header and footer drawn in the same frame
  └─ Screen ───────── aristotle-hal Framebuffer: blit black and white, A2, wait; blit gray, GL16, wait
```

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `style.rs` | Geometry and typesetting defaults (`Style::pw4`) |
| `book.rs` | Opening, engine choice, lazy pagination, chapter titles, rendering and composition |
| `lang.rs` | Hyphenation language for EPUBs that declare several |
| `mobi.rs` | MOBI 7 decoder and EPUB writer |
| `page.rs` | Page buffers, the black and white frame, header and footer |
| `screen.rs` | The page turn on the panel |

## How Plato is consumed

`plato-core` is not on crates.io, needs a few changes, and links about fifteen C libraries. The setup:

- **Source.** `tools/prepare-plato-src.sh` writes `git archive` of the commit the `third_party/plato` submodule pins, plus `tools/plato-patches/plato-*.patch`, to `third_party/plato-patched/` (gitignored). The submodule is never modified. The script is idempotent: a stamp holds the commit and a hash of the patches.
- **Patches** (each small, with a description at the top):
  - `0001`: static musl linking (from the Plato cross-build, `tools/build-plato.sh`);
  - `0002`: `PLATO_LIB_DIRS` lets another workspace point `build.rs` at the static archives, and the x86_64 musl host target is accepted;
  - `0003`: MuPDF's embedded-font symbol names on every musl target (Zig's MuPDF build uses the same names on x86_64 as on ARM);
  - `0004`: `EpubDocument::set_language`, see "Hyphenation".
- **C libraries.** `tools/build-plato.sh` builds them with Zig as static archives: for the device as before, and with `PLATO_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl PLATO_LIBS_ONLY=1` for the host (about 6 minutes on 2 cores, once).
- **Workspace.** `crates/aristotle-render` is its own Cargo workspace and the root workspace excludes it, so `cargo build` at the root keeps working on hosts that never ran the Plato build. It depends on `../../third_party/plato-patched/crates/core` by path and on `aristotle-hal`. Its `Cargo.lock` started from Plato's, so dependency versions match the tested Plato build.
- **Build.** `tools/build-render.sh device|host` prepares the source, sets `PLATO_LIB_DIRS` and the Zig C compiler (for `zstd-sys`), builds, and assembles the bundle in `~/.cache/aristotle/render/<device|host>/`. `CARGO_CMD=clippy|test` runs those instead. `PLATO_BUILD` selects a `build-plato.sh` output directory (default `plato-build/main`, or `host-x86_64`).

Why not a `[patch]` section in the root workspace: it would make every root build depend on the prepared source and the C libraries. Why not build against the copy inside a `build-plato.sh` run: that copy is patched once when the run starts and goes stale when patches change, and its location differs per run.

### Host previews

The host build is the same code linked against the same library versions built for x86_64 musl, so previews match the device apart from floating-point rounding. Render and convert:

```sh
~/.cache/aristotle/render/host/aristotle-render render BOOK.epub 10 page.raw
~/.cache/aristotle/venv/bin/python -I devloop/host/fb2png.py page.raw page.png
```

### Runtime data

Plato opens fonts, stylesheets and hyphenation patterns by paths relative to the current directory, so the CLI changes into its data directory (`data/` next to the binary, or `--data`). `tools/build-render.sh` assembles it:

| Path | Contents | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fonts/` | The 12 fonts Plato's engine loads unconditionally (Libertinus Serif, Noto Sans, Source Code, Parisienne, Delius) | Plato source tree |
| `serif/` | Literata, the body and chrome font | `crates/aristotle-render/assets/fonts/` (OFL, committed with its licence) |
| `css/` | `epub.css`, `html.css` | Plato source tree |
| `hyphenation-patterns/` | `pl`, `en-us`, `en-gb`, `de-1996`, `fr` (`HYPH_LANGS`) | Plato 0.9.45 release archive, pinned by SHA-256 |

Converted MOBI books go to `cache/` next to the binary (or `--cache`).

## Typesetting defaults

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Font | Literata 10 pt | Designed for e-reading; sturdy serifs and a large x-height that hold up in 16 grays; full Polish coverage (ą ć ę ł ń ó ś ź ż, „ ” – …); OFL. Its x-height makes 10 pt read like 11 pt of Libertinus. |
| Leading | 1.3 em | Literata is dark and tall; Plato's 1.2 felt cramped. |
| Alignment | Justified | With Polish hyphenation the gaps stay small. |
| Side margins | 5 mm (59 px) | Plato takes whole millimetres. |
| Text block | 104 px from the top, 100 px from the bottom | Leaves bands for the header and footer. Plato's margins are uniform, so the layout area is shifted up and down to put the text block there; the chrome is drawn over Plato's white margins. |
| Header | Chapter title (book title if unknown), Literata Italic 7 pt, gray 0x40, centred | 0x40 is below the A2 threshold, so the header is legible in the black and white frame too. |
| Footer | `x / y` centred, percent at the right margin, 7 pt | Drawn in the same frame as the text: no separate footer update, unlike stock. |

At 10 pt a line holds about 42 to 45 characters on the 81 mm text width. That is narrow for justified text; the occasional loose line remains even with hyphenation. 9 pt (`--font-size 9`) gives about 50 characters. The owner asked for 10 to 11 pt, so 10 is the default.

Plato's own paragraph defaults apply (Knuth–Plass `total_fit`, hyphen penalty 50, stretch tolerance 1.26). The book's CSS is honoured.

## Hyphenation

- Plato's patterns (kl-hyphenate, from hyph-utf8) **include Polish**: `pl.standard.bincode`, minima 2 and 2. Checked word by word: zo-ba-czy-my, po-dob-ne, prze-ci-wień-stwem, rze-czy-wi-stość, Szcze-cin.
- Plato picks patterns per element from `lang`/`xml:lang` and otherwise from the book's **first** `dc:language` (`pl`, `pl-PL` and `PL` all map to Polish). Without a language it uses English.
- Problem found in the owner's library: 2 of 44 Polish EPUBs declare several languages, and one lists `de-DE` first. It was hyphenated with German patterns ("zobac-zymy", "pod-obne"). Patch `0004` adds a language override, and `lang.rs` decides it for books that declare more than one: it samples about 190 KB of the text and picks the declared language whose marker letters (ąćęłńśźż for Polish, äöüß for German, ...) are most frequent. `--lang TAG` forces a language.
- `aristotle-render info BOOK` prints the language and whether its patterns are loaded.
- Plato loads every pattern file present in `hyphenation-patterns/` on first use (9 ms on the host for five languages), which is why the bundle ships only a few.

## MOBI

MuPDF reads MOBI, but its HTML layout has no Polish patterns, uses its own fonts and justifies poorly. So `mobi.rs` converts DRM-free MOBI 7 books once to a stored (uncompressed) EPUB in the cache and Plato's engine lays that out like any EPUB, with the language from EXTH 524 (or the header's locale). It handles PalmDOC and uncompressed text, UTF-8 and CP1252, trailing record entries, images, `<mbp:pagebreak/>` chapter splits, MOBI's paragraph attributes, and the HTML that Plato's XML parser can't take (void elements, unquoted attributes, unclosed paragraphs). DRM, HUFF/CDIC compression and KF8-only files fall back to MuPDF; joint MOBI/KF8 files use their MOBI 7 part. `--no-convert` forces MuPDF.

The host has no MOBI files; `devloop/host/make-test-mobi.py` makes a MOBI 7 test book from an EPUB.

## Pages and progress

For Plato's engine a location is a byte offset into the book's text. Pages are found by walking `Location::Next`, which lays out one spine item (chapter file) at a time and caches its pages. `x / y` needs the whole book laid out: `render`, `show` and `turn` paginate first unless `--percent` is given. Progress is `x / y` once paginated, else the byte offset over the book's size. For MuPDF documents locations are page indices and the count is known.

## Page turn on the device

`show` and `turn` use the decided strategy: blit the page thresholded at gray 160 to pure black and white, A2, wait (visible); blit the anti-aliased page, GL16, wait (settled). `turn` starts from a clean GC16 page, then for each page reports render time (CPU), visible and settled (panel, from the blit), and their sums. Both refuse to run while the stock framework (`cvm`) is up.

## Measurements

Host (x86_64, release build), Literata 10 pt:

| Book | Open | First page | Render per page (median / p90) | Paginate all | Max RSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platon, *Fedon* (EPUB, 341 pages) | 1.1 ms | 0.6 ms | 2.1 / 2.4 ms | 211 ms | 32 MiB |
| Arystoteles, *Etyka nikomachejska* (EPUB, 269 pages) | 10 ms | 1.9 ms | 4.6 / 5.2 ms | 241 ms | 26 MiB |

"Render" is Plato rasterising the page; composing the chrome adds about 0.3 ms and the black and white frame 0.1 to 0.2 ms. Laying out a new chapter happens when a page turn crosses into it (25 to 70 ms on the host), and dominates the worst case.

Device numbers: pending the first `bench` and `turn` runs [dev].

## Open issues

- **Device timings unknown.** Glyphs are rasterised by FreeType on every render (Plato has no glyph cache) and blended pixel by pixel; chapter layout runs on the turn that enters the chapter. If either is too slow on the Cortex-A9: render the next page while the current one settles, lay out the next chapter ahead, add a glyph cache.
- **Pagination cost.** `x / y` lays out the whole book on open. A reader needs a per-book pagination cache keyed by file and style.
- **Memory.** Plato keeps the display lists of every laid-out chapter. Host RSS is 26 to 32 MiB after full pagination; check on the device against the 40 MB target.
- **Polish typographic rules.** Single-letter words (a, i, o, u, w, z) can end a line; Polish typesetting keeps them with the next word. Needs a non-breaking space pass before layout.
- **MOBI.** No table of contents yet (NCX index records), so the header shows the book title; `filepos` links are dropped; HUFF/CDIC books are not converted.
- **Binary size.** 25 MB for ARM, mostly MuPDF's embedded fonts. MuPDF build flags (`TOFU_*`, no CJK) can cut it.
- **Images.** Book CSS decides placement; `margin: auto` centring is not honoured by Plato's engine.
